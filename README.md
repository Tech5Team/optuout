## **Instructions**

1. **Verification login with google account.**
2. **Input First and Last name into the search field along with City and State.**
3. **Hit "Get Started" and allow the application time to search and flag the sites that contain your information.**
4. **A popup will indicate which sites have an information profile with an "!". If flagged, this pop up will also contain a redirect link to their specific opt out process.**

* **_The opt out process is different for some sites, but a majority of them have similar processes where you copy the searched profile of your name + city/state.
You then use that profile URL within their opt out process. The video above showcases this type of process_**
